# terminalsnakegame
## I made this game when I was very new to C++. Pardon me for some of the bad practices I may have used.

A snake game completely made in the terminal with C++. 
(I couldn't figure out how to make it not stutter at the time since I wasn't aware of solutions to circumvent the buffer rewritting everything)
